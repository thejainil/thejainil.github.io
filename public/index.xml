&lt;p&gt;in 2011, software was gospel. code was the highest form of creation. if you could write it, you were untouchable. silicon valley was a cathedral, and y combinator crowned the high priests. build the software, raise the capital, scale it fast enough, and you could bend industries to your will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but something changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fast forward to today, and software is everywhere—cheap, abundant, almost boring. ai walked in and kicked the door wide open. anyone with a browser and a prompt can summon code. the secret spells have become autocomplete suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;every decade or so, a new playbook emerges that reshapes how we think about scaling businesses. not in the way trends come and go, but in the way fundamental shifts force everyone to play a different game.in the 2000s, qualcomm figured out how to license IP instead of manufacturing chips. in the 2010s, aws made infrastructure something you rented, not owned. now, in 2024, we’re watching the biggest shift yet: the separation of intelligence from service delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;i’ve always used analogies to make sense of things. the world feels less like chaos when you can map one thing onto another, when you can see patterns in places they weren’t meant to be. like how social media is a hacked version of real life—dopamine on demand, without the friction of actual human connection. or how caffeine is a hacked version of sleep—borrowing energy you don’t have, a loan you have to pay back with interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>social capital - built, not borrowed</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-capital---built-not-borrowed&#34;&gt;social capital - built, not borrowed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i never thought much about social capital until i needed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s not about networking. networking is rehearsed, curated. a kind of social currency that expires the moment someone realizes you’re trying to withdraw more than you’ve deposited. social capital, on the other hand, is organic. it’s built slowly, through trust, through shared experiences, through the quiet moments that don’t seem important at the time but become the foundation of everything later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;i grew up in ahmedabad, a city where centuries of commerce still fuel the daily grind. childhood evenings were a mix of cricket and building stuff-  be it lego scorpion, clash royale bot or just some origami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;family dinners used to revolve around businesses, number crunching, pro - capitalistic talks. my dad and uncles used to run traditional businesses in different sectors - desi business mentors fr. first venture w my cousin - building a supply chain for an online firecracker shop. it was 11th grade.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
