## social capital - built, not borrowed

i never thought much about social capital until i needed it.

it’s not about networking. networking is rehearsed, curated. a kind of social currency that expires the moment someone realizes you’re trying to withdraw more than you’ve deposited. social capital, on the other hand, is organic. it’s built slowly, through trust, through shared experiences, through the quiet moments that don’t seem important at the time but become the foundation of everything later.

some people are born into it. they inherit networks, last names, institutions that vouch for them before they even speak. for the rest of us, it has to be built brick by brick. and it takes time. longer than you think. you show up for people, even when you don’t need anything from them. you do things without expecting a return. you offer help when it’s inconvenient. and then one day, when you need it, it’s there. not because you asked for it, but because that’s how it works.

but here’s the thing. social capital isn’t just about climbing. it’s not a ladder. it’s more like a web. and the strongest webs aren’t built by connecting to people above you, but by strengthening the bonds all around you. the people at your level, the ones just starting out, the ones no one is paying attention to yet.

this isn’t just a personal thing. entire communities rise or fall based on the strength of their social capital. neighborhoods where people look out for each other thrive. workplaces where trust runs deep outperform those held together by rules and bureaucracy. economies with high social capital—where people believe in fairness, in reciprocity—grow faster, last longer.

twitter stands out as a non-intrusive social network where tech enthusiasts converge. it's an excellent platform if used correctly. engaging with others, sharing insightful thoughts, and building interesting things can help you gain social capital. direct messaging can also be a powerful tool, especially if you have a significant number of followers.

being part of small online communities like superteam can be beneficial as they often consist of interesting individuals who are likely to know other interesting people. contributing to these communities without constantly promoting your product can help you build social capital.

the best part about social capital is its accessibility. anyone can acquire it by engaging in meaningful conversations and providing value to others. just like stocks, those with a lot of social capital recognize the long-term potential of individuals who provide value. almost no one would turn down a conversation with a potential brian chesky.

you invest. not in the obvious places, but in the quiet ones. in the people who aren’t useful to you yet. in the relationships that don’t seem to have an immediate return. in communities that don’t have power now but will, someday. you keep showing up. because in the end, social capital is just another way of saying: we’re in this together. and the more you believe that, the stronger it gets.
